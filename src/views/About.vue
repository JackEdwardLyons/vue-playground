    <p>
      I've been working as a web developer for 3+ years, primarily focusing on Front End Development.
    </p>
    <p>
      I love writing clean, modern JavaScript and always strive to keep up-to-date with all the latest
      tools and language features.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the past 12 months I have really taken a liking to Vue js - It's clean, simple to write and incredibly
      powerful. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm going to use this page to explore all the latest new libraries, tools and features of the
      Vue ecosystem.
